## Meeting Notes (16.04.25)

### Sensorimotor Team

-   Jean-Sebastian (UBC), Chris (UBC), Patrick (Netherlands)
    -   1â€“2 PM PT cut-off to meet with Patrick

### Communication

-   Platform: Element

### Data

-   Data collection is continuous (human experiments with assumptions involved)
-   Includes:
    -   Head accelerations
    -   Muscle activity (electrical signals)
-   Well-documented code exists to convert sensor data to 3D linear acceleration
-   All current models are in MATLAB
-   Plan to:
    -   Use existing models as inputs and to understand features
    -   Once in correct reference frame, convert angular velocity to neural code (?)

### Project Overview + Discussions

#### Goal

-   Build a probabilistic model that distinguishes between internal and external movements
-   Understand how the brain infers if motion comes from its own decisions
-   Tackle the issue of awareness and self-agency

#### Key Points

-   Movement can be defined using torques, forces, and displacements, but the brain can't directly access these
-   Brain interprets action vs potential (binary: 1 vs 0)
-   Combine biological and computational models

#### Approach

-   Understand existing computational models and identify features
-   Work on head acceleration and leg electrical activity data collected in the lab
-   Create a probabilistic model for vestibular data
-   Start simple: test with a single signal representation before scaling up to thousands of cells/electrical signals
-   Expand to other "senses" if time permits

#### Hackathon Goal

-   Fully understand the data and problem
-   Understand the modelling table (axis, predictors, target, other variables)
-   Develop a software engineering plan (data analysis pipelines + scripts)

### Meetings/Logistics

-   Two weekly meetings (timings TBD):
    -   Internal (MDS team)
    -   External (with partner)

### Github

-   OK to create a public GitHub repository
-   Use MIT license
-   Hide data and outputs using `.gitignore`
-   OK to include the project as a capstone project on resumes

### Next Steps for MDS Team

-   Share Element IDs with partner (to add to chat channel)
-   Share GitHub usernames (to add to the Sensorimotor GitHub organization)
-   Create MathWorks accounts (to access existing MATLAB codes)
-   Set up UBC Drive Cloud to upload data
-   Schedule a meeting before April 28th to walk through the existing model (or plan to do this during the hackathon)
-   Book conference rooms in ESB for in-person weekly meetings
-   Read the literature review and discuss it during the hackathon to build domain expertise

### Next Steps for Sensorimotor team

-   Add MDS team to the Element chat channel
-   Add MDS team to the GitHub organization
