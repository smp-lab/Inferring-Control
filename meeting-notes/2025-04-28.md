# Meeting Notes – 28/04/2025

## Data-Related
- Two formats of motor commands are available: firing rate and spikes
  - Firing rate: Continuous values (in Hz). For example, with a delta_t of 0.2 seconds, this corresponds to 5 Hz.
  - Spikes: Binary signal, where "1" means firing (neuron reaches threshold) and "0" means no firing.
- We only need to choose one format to work with, and we will start with continuous firing rate data.
- The two CSV files (motor commands and vestibular signals):
  - Should have matching numbers of rows since they are aligned time series.
  - Can be joined directly based on the time index.
- The motor command simulation data represent self-initiated movements:
  - In the lab setup ("standing for posture"), motor commands are generated to maintain balance.
  - Therefore, we expect a correlation between motor commands and vestibular signals.

## Model / Paper-Related
- This is not a supervised learning problem. It is an inferential modeling task focused on correlation analysis.
- Main focus is on continuous behavior:
  - Correlation is computed over segments; individual timestamps are less critical for now.
- Lag interpretation:
  - For external forces, vestibular signals lead motor commands.
  - For self-initiated movements, motor commands lead vestibular signals.
- 2 ms timestep between observations.

## Analysis Plan
- For each pair of signals (X and Y), X will be shifted relative to Y, while Y remains unchanged.
- Circular shifting will be used (i.e., when shifting past the end, data wraps around to the beginning).
- The dataset contains:
  - 10 motor command units × 12 vestibular input units = 120 pairs.
- For each pair:
  - Compute the full cross-correlation curve (similar to MCD_Corr(t) in the paper, Page 2, plot b).
  - Identify the maximum correlation and the corresponding lag.

## Visualization
- Full cross-correlation plots for all 120 pairs (for detailed analysis).
- Heatmaps can be used to help visualize and capture overall trends more easily
- Variability in the shape and lag of the cross-correlation curves is expected due to biological factors, such as differences in vestibular input pathways (e.g., varying distances from the brain or differences in signal conduction speeds).
